<h2>Panarai Gatenil:</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;" text-align="center"><img src="IMG_0720.JPG" alt="Picture of Prim."></p>
<br>
<p>I am 15-years-old, and I live in Arleta. I currently go to John H. Francis Polytechnic
High School in Sun Valley. I enjoy running which is why I ran the LA marathon of 2018
and joined my school's track and field team. On the track and field team, I run the relays,
run the 100, and do long jump. On the weekends, I volunteer at Discovery Cube LA and my temple.
One of my pet peeves is when people do not recycle bottles and cans, which is why I have
decided to use the environment for the theme of this project. You can contact me at: "
panaraipg@gmail.com"</p>
